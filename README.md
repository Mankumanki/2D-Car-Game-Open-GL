# 2D-Car-Game-Open-GL
A normal 2D car game will update later by adding 3D models
I tried to add textures but they won't load,earlier textures were working.
Made,using Open GL API. 
For this to run you need to have the dll files that i just provided and some Open GL libraries like GLFW,GLEW,GLM and for textures you need to have image loader header files
like (i)SOIL or (ii)STBI Image loader.
